# DualFinder
You don't need an app to have two-pane file management on Mac OS X

Goal: make Mac Finder act more like the Total Commander in Windows
	
1. Ideally, free - use free apps and applescript/automator  (to Service menu) 
2. Dual window mode - 2 windows side by side
3. Bring keyboard shortcuts to Mac
4. (Ideally) Use only Mac OS X native technology - Applescript, Automator, service menu or modifying shortcut keys.
5. (Ideally) No resident app

Background

1. Total Commander (previously known as Windows Commander) does not have Mac version
2. The alternative apps try to fulfill the vacancy using various approaches:
2a. Plugin to Finder - XtraFinder & TotalFinder
2b. Stand alone app - PathFinder, Double Commander and Commander One
3. Reasons *not* to choose these solution:
3a. Pricy
3b. Have another app running in addition to Finder, which is required for "select file" dialog 

Solution
1. Use original Finder windows and use one of the following to change

a. keyboard shortcut remap app
b. Applescript in Automator
c. Custom keyboard shortcuts of Finder menu items in System Preference
