# DualFinder
You don't need an app to have two-pane file management on Mac OS X

Goal: 

Make Mac Finder act more like the Total Commander in Windows
	
1. Ideally, free - use free (or low price) apps and applescript/automator  (to Service menu) 

2. Dual window mode - 2 windows side by side

3. Bring keyboard shortcuts to Mac

4. (Ideally) Use only Mac OS X native technology - Applescript, Automator, service menu or modifying shortcut keys.

5. (Ideally) No resident app

Background

1. Total Commander (previously known as Windows Commander) does not have Mac version

2. The alternative apps try to fulfill the vacancy using various approaches:

2a. Plugin to Finder - XtraFinder & TotalFinder

2b. Stand alone app - PathFinder, Double Commander and Commander One

3.Reasons *not* to choose these solution:

3a. Pricy

3b. Have another app running in addition to Finder, which is required for "select file" dialog 

Solution

1. Use original Finder windows and use one of the following to change

A. Applescript in Automator or Custom keyboard shortcuts of Finder menu items in System Preference

Since there is no resident app installed, there will be some manual set up procedure to follow in order to get things in place. Please go to teh Wiki page of this site to see the procedure.

B. keyboard shortcut remap app

If you are willing to install (or happens to have) an app which has the ability to remap keyboard shortcut, it will be a lot easier. I will provide packages for the following apps:

A. BetterTouchTool

B. Alfred
